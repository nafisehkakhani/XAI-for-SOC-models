## Usage

1. To access the LUCAS topsoil dataset (ground truth), visit: [LUCAS Topsoil Dataset](https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/topsoil-physical-properties-europe-based-lucas-topsoil-data)
2. For the base code to download and climate data (input features for ML models), please refer to: [SoilNet GitHub Repository](https://github.com/moienr/SoilNet)

Once you have prepared the inputs and outputs (soil organic carbon - SOC in g/kg), save them as a .csv file.

This repository will be updated gradually. Meanwhile, do not hesitate to contact me via: nafiseh.kakhani@uni-tuebingen.de
