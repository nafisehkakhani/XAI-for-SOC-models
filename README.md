## Usage

1. To access the LUCAS topsoil dataset (ground truth), visit: [LUCAS Topsoil Dataset](https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/topsoil-physical-properties-europe-based-lucas-topsoil-data)
2. For the base code to download and climate data (input features for ML models), please refer to: [SoilNet GitHub Repository](https://github.com/moienr/SoilNet)

3. The methodolgy for XAI is heavily based on [CXplain](https://github.com/d909b/cxplain). Please install related conda packages and make sure of the compability of the versions.
